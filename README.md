# Heat Network Process Flow

This is a React based application designed to visualize and interact with heat network process flow diagrams. It uses a flowchart style UI to represent components of a heat network data such as temperature, flow rate, and power consumption. The app allows users to view and track the flow of heat and other parameters through various components, visualizing the system's energy exchange and process dynamics.

### Features

- Visual representation of components and their connections.
- Interactive flowchart with customizable node types and connections.
- Ability to visualize process streams with different colors and flow directions.
