# Heat Network Process Flow

This is a React based application designed to visualize and interact with heat network process flow diagrams. It uses a flowchart style UI to represent components of a heat network data such as temperature, flow rate, and power consumption. The app allows users to view and track the flow of heat and other parameters through various components, visualizing the system's energy exchange and process dynamics.

### Features

- Visual representation of components and their connections.
- Interactive flowchart with customizable node types and connections.
- Ability to visualize process streams with different colors and flow directions.

## Prerequisites:

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### Getting started:
#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vishalkanteppa/Process-Flow-Diagram.git
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies.
```bash
cd Process-Flow-Diagram
npm install
```

#### 3. Run the server
Start the development server to run the app locally.
```bash
npm run dev
```
Once the server is up and running, you can access the app at:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
Note: If port 5173 is already in use on your local system, the app will automatically try another available port. Just check the terminal output for the updated port number if needed.
